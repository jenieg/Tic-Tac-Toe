# My Process

### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS Custom Properties
  - CSS Grid
  - Javascript ES6

### What I learned

  With various new techniques I was able to design the gameboard and the X's and O's using CSS. Additionally, solving the structure of my JavaScript for layout logic was a fulfilling experience.

### Continued development

   I am eager to further my understanding and expertise in leveraging JavaScript's capabilities to enhance and innovate in upcoming projects.
